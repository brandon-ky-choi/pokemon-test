# Pokedex Challenge

## Available Scripts

First run `npm install` to install dependencies.

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run start` - runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3006](http://localhost:3006) to view it in the browser.

- `npm run build` - builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## GOAL

Create a small project using [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) with the follow requirements:

1. Get 20 Pokemons and list their names in an unordered list.
2. When clicking on a list item, show the details of the Pokemon on the same page below the list. The details displayed should include name, id, height, weight and sprite (image).
3. Implement a search functionality to filter the list, and find any of the pokemon by name.
4. Add a favourites button to allow the user to add pokemon to their list of favourites.
5. Save the selected favorite pokemon so they are remembered even after refreshing the page.

## What we care about

### Ask questions!

The challenge is intentionally left somewhat open ended to simulate the sort of requirement that might come from product. There's no way to get this right without asking questions to figure out what the product team really wants, what data is available to you, etc.

### Talk out loud

Walk us through what you're trying to do as you're trying to do it. That will help us understand your thought process and make sure we haven't led you astray!

### Readability

We take care to write code that our teammates can come back to and understand later. Make your intention clear as you write.

### Architecture

We want to see how you think we should organize the application to meet the business needs. What components do we need? What libraries do we need? What libraries can we omit?

## What we don't care about

### Typos and other minor mistakes

Relax! We try to make this fun and certainly aren't judging whether you make a spelling mistake, miss a comma, or anything like that.

### Optimizations

Something that works can always be made faster, let's get something working first because it may already be fast enough!

### Copy/pasting from documentation or other projects

Please do! Effectively searching for examples of similar problems that have already been solved is certainly part of programming, so don't reinvent the wheel!

## What would be assessed in each task?
01. Navigating an API docs, making an API call and rendering the response
02. React components, hooks and event handling
03. State/prop handling.
04. Understanding of best practices
